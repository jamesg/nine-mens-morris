    <h1>Nine Men's Morris</h1>
    <p>
    A Javascript implementation of the ancient strategy game for two players.
    </p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>
    The game has two stages.  In the first stage, players start with nine men
    each and take turns to place them on any unoccupied point.  Three men of
    the same player placed along a straight line form a mill.  When a player
    forms a mill, they may remove one of their opponent's men.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once both players have placed all nine men, they take turns to move their
    own men one step at a time along the board lines.  Whenever a player forms
    a mill, they may remove one man from their opponent.
    </p>
    <h2>Strategy</h2>
    <p>
    A good strategy is to place men along two parallel lines, so that you can
    form a mill on every turn by moving a man between the two lines.
    </p>
    <h2>Alternative Rules</h2>
    <p>
    Some versions of the game enter a third stage when one player is reduced to
    three men.  The weaker player no longer needs to move men one space each
    turn, but may 'fly' to any unoccupied point on the board.
    Most rules stipulate that when removing an opponent's man, a man not in a
    mill should be selected if possible.  This minor rule is omitted in this
    version.
